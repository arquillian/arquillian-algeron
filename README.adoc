== What is Pact?

In microservices architecture you typically have one or more services that make remote calls to one or more services to get information from them.

For example you might have one service called _BeerService_ that returns information of a beer.
But this service needs to call another service _CommentsService_ which returns the comments that users has done for given beer.
After _BeerService_ receives all the comments for that beer, everything is packed and sent to the client.

So as you can see there is a communication between both services where one needs to know what and how to send data such as name of fields, type of data or status code (_CommentsService_) and another one that needs to know how to interpret what is received (_BeerService_).

It seems obvious that it must exist some kind of agreement between them so they can understand each other correctly in all of their communications.

https://docs.pact.io/[Pact] is a framework that provides support for Consumer Driven Contracts testing.
Pact is implemented in several languages such as Ruby, JVM, .NET, JavaScript, Go and Swift

=== Consumer Driven Contracts

A *Contract* is a collection of agreements between a client ( or Consumer which in previous example is _BeerService_) and an API (or Provider which in previous example is _CommentsService_) that describes the interactions that can take place between them.

In summary *Consumer Driven Contracts* is a pattern that drives the development of the Provider from its Consumers point of view.
This means that consumer describes what and how he wants to receive the information, describing in form of contract and then provider implements its service following that contract.
When the client validates that can consume what it is been defined in the contract and provider validates that what he produces meets the contract, then you can be sure that contract expectations are met and they will be able to communicate each other.

Also notice that thanks of these tests, if anyone changes the client or the server side to not meet the contract, you'll detect before it is deployed to production.

You can read more about Consumer-Driven contracts http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html[here] or at book https://www.manning.com/books/testing-java-microservices[Testing Java Microservices] chapter 6.

=== How Pact works?

Obviously any Contract test is composed by two faces, one for the consumer and another one for the provider and a contract file that is sent from consumer to provider.
Let's see the steps to write contract tests using Pact.

. Consumer expectations are set up on a mock server.
In this way consumer doesn't need to know how to deploy a provider (since it might not be trivial to do it, and probably at the end you'll end up writing end-to-end tests instead of contract tests).
So consumer tests its client/gateway code to communicate against a mock server.
. When consumer tests are run, mocked requests and responses are written into a "pact" file, which in fact it is the contract that has been defined in consumer part.
. The "pact" file are sent to provider project to be replayed against the provider service.
Then real responses from provider are checked against the expected responses defined in contract.
. If consumer is able to produce a "pact" file and provider meets all the expectations, then you can say that contract is verified by both parties and will be able to communicate.

These steps can be summarized in next diagram:

== Arquillian Pact

https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm[Pact-JVM] is an implementation for JVM languages of Pact.

Arquillian Pact is the integration of all Arquillian philosophy/extensions into Consumer Driven Contracts approach using Pact-JVM.

=== Arquillian Pact Consumer

First thing to do is develop the *Consumer* part of the test.
Consumer part of Consumer-Driven Contract defines requirements from the consumer of the API which are then used to develop the client interaction with the API as well as to validate provider implementation.

==== Arquillian Pact Consumer In Container

Arquillian has two modes of working *In Container* (which means having a `@Deployment` method) and Arquillian takes care of managing lifecycle of the server and deploy the archive, or *Standalone* (no `@Deployment` method) where Arquillian assumes that everything is already deployed.

Let's see how to write the consumer part in In Container mode.

First thing to do is add typical Arquillian dependencies such as Arquillian bom and the dependency of the container you want to use.
Nothing new here:

----
<1> Notice that I am using Chameleon generic container, you can read more http://www.lordofthejars.com/2016/09/arquillian-chameleon-for-sake-of.html[here].

Then you need to add `arquillian-pact-consumer` dependency as well as `pact-jvm-consumer` dependency:

----
<1> Arquillian Pact has been tested with latest version, but it should work with any 3.X version.

After dependencies you can write the test that defines the contract:


[[incontainer]]
[source, java]
.ClientGatewayTest.java
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class) // <1>
public class ClientGatewayTest {

    @Deployment // <2>
    public static JavaArchive createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(JavaArchive.class).addClasses(ClientGateway.class);
    }

    @Pact(provider="test_provider", consumer="test_consumer") // <3>
    public PactFragment createFragment(PactDslWithProvider builder) {

        Map<String, String> header = new HashMap<>();
        header.put("Content-Type", "application/json");

        return builder
                .given("test state")
                .uponReceiving("ConsumerTest test interaction")
                .path("/")
                .method("GET")
                .willRespondWith()
                .status(200)
                .headers(header)
                .body("{\"responsetest\": true, \"name\": \"harry\"}")
                .toFragment(); // <4>
    }

    @EJB // <5>
    ClientGateway clientGateway;

    @Test
    @PactVerification("test_provider") // <6>
    public void should_return_message() throws IOException {
        assertThat(clientGateway.getMessage(), is("{\"responsetest\": true, \"name\": \"harry\"}")); // <7>
    }
}
----
<1> Arquillian Runner
<2> Defines what you want to deploy to defined container. In this case an EJB that acts as gateway to another service
<3> To define the contract you need to configure expectations of mock server. This is done by annotating a method with `@Pact` annotation and setting the provider and consumer name
<4> A Pact method returns a fragment of the contract which might be the complete contract or not
<5> Typical Arquillian enrichment
<6> Defines which provider is validated when this test method is executed.
<7> Asserts that the gateway can read the kind of messages sent by provider. Notice that now it is pretty simple, but in real test you'll test for example that message is correctly bound to an object.

After this test is executed, contract is placed at `target/pacts` directory.
Then you can send contract to provider side.

Notice that contract and/or mock responses are defined using Pact DSL.
You can read more about this DSL at https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm/tree/master/pact-jvm-consumer-junit#using-the-pact-dsl-directly[Using the Pact DSL directly].

Important things to retain from consumer part:

* It is an Arquillian test so you can use anything that Arquillian provides.
* Methods annotated with `@Pact` defines a fragment of the contract that at same time is used by mock server for providing responses.
* In case of using several methods annotated with `@Pact` annotation, you need to use `fragment` attribute `@PactVerification(.. fragment="methodName")`to set which fragment is under test for each `@Test` method.

TIP: You can use `@Pact` annotation at class level, so methods that defines a pact fragment, just need to return `PactFragment` class. Information will be picked from class level. In case of setting annotation at class and method level too, the one defined on the method will take precedence.

You can see the full example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-pact/tree/master/consumer/ftest-incontainer[ftest-incontainer]

==== Arquillian Pact Consumer Standalone

*Standalone* mode (no `@Deployment` method), Arquillian assumes that everything is already deployed.

The only difference between previous example is that you only need `arquillian-junit-standalone` instead of `arquilian-junit-container` and don't need to define any container adapter.
Obviously no `@Deployment` method is required:

[source, java]
.ConsumerTest.java
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class ConsumerTest {

    @Pact(provider = "test_provider", consumer = "test_consumer")
    public PactFragment createFragment(PactDslWithProvider builder) {

        Map<String, String> header = new HashMap<>();
        header.put("Content-Type", "application/json");

        return builder
                .given("test state")
                .uponReceiving("ConsumerTest test interaction")
                .path("/")
                .method("GET")
                .willRespondWith()
                .status(200)
                .headers(header)
                .body("{\"responsetest\": true, \"name\": \"harry\"}")
                .toFragment();
    }

    @Test
    @PactVerification("test_provider")
    public void runTest() throws IOException {
        new ConsumerClient().get().body("name", equalTo("harry"));
        assertThat(new File("target/pacts/test_consumer-test_provider.json")).exists();
    }

}
----

Code is pretty similar as <<incontainer, previous test>> but now the consumer client/gateway object is instantiated as plain java object instead of container managed.

You can see the full example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-pact/tree/master/consumer/ftest[ftest]

==== Arquillian Pact Consumer Configuration

Arquillian Pact Consumer can be configured using Arquillian configuration mechanism (`arquillian.xml` file or system properties).

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
    http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

    <extension qualifier="pact-consumer">
        <property name="pactSpecVersion">1</property>
    </extension>

</arquillian>
----

The attributes are:

|===
| Attribute Name | Description | Default Value

|host
|Bind host for mock server
|localhost

|port
|Listening port for mock server
|9090

|pactSpecVesion
|Pact specification version as integer
|3

|https
|If mock server should start using https instead of http
|false

|provider
|If you want to set provider globally
|

|pactArtifactVersion
|By default Arquillian Pact packages pact dependencies in container tests. To get the version of artifacts to package, checks the current pact version of classpath.
 If you want to use another one rather the one defined in your classpath, you can set it here the version.
|

|pactReportDir
|Directory where contracts are stored.
|target/pacts

|publishContracts
|Enables publication of contracts after test suite execution. See <<Pact publisher>> section.
|false

|pactPublishConfiguration
|yaml-like document for configuring different pact publishers. See <<Pact publisher>> section.
|
|===

==== Pact publisher

Arquillian Pact also offers additional ways to of publishing "pact" contract files comparing to what Pact itself is providing.
With Pact you usually need to relay on the build tool to publish "pact" files.
Pact offers a Maven and Gradle plugin for publishing contracts to Pact Broker, but if you want to use Git repository or sharing contracts through an arbitrary folder, then you’ll need to start hacking the build tool which is not always as easy as it should be :)

In Arquillian Pact we have defined a Pact Publishing SPI so you can implement your own publisher.
We currently support three different publishers - Folder, URL[POST method] and Git.

It is important to note that by default `publishContracts` configuration attribute is `false`.
This means that when you run any consumer contract test, contracts are not published.
`publishContracts` configuration attribute should be only set to `true`if and only if you are publishing a new version of a consumer, and this will be done by your CI/CD environment.

[TIP]
====
Arquillian can be configured using system properties or environment variables.
If you want to enable pact publishing feature only in CI/CD, you can set environment variable `arq.extension.pact-consumer.publishContracts` to true.
====

==== Folder Publisher

Folder publisher copies "pact" files from configured output directory (by default `target/pacts`) to another directory.
To configure folder publisher you need to configure `pactPublishConfiguration` with next configuration:

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
    http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

    <extension qualifier="pact-consumer">
        <property name="pactPublishConfiguration">
            provider: folder # <1>
            outputFolder: /mypacts # <2>
        </property>
    </extension>

</arquillian>
----
<1> `provider` attribute is used for setting which publisher to use. In case of Folder publisher, you need to set to `folder`.
<2> `outputFolder` configures where to copy "pact" files.

You can set `outputFolder` value using Java system property or environment variable by using form `${name:-defaultvalue}.
For example `outputFolder: ${output:-/mypacts}` will first check if there is a Java system property with name output and get the value, if there is no value, then checks for environment variable.
If that is not defined too it will use the default value i.e. `/mypacts`.

==== URL Publisher

URL publisher sends a `POST` request to configured URL, appending at the end of the URL the "pact" filename and sending the contract content as body content.
For example given `http://myhost/pacts` and a "pact" file called `consumer_provider.json`, the resulting URL would be: `http://myhost/pacts/consumer_provider.json`

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
    http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

    <extension qualifier="pact-consumer">
        <property name="pactPublishConfiguration">
            provider: url # <1>
            url: http://localhost:8081/pacts # <2>
        </property>
    </extension>

</arquillian>
----
<1> `provider` attribute is used for setting which publisher to use. In case of URL publisher, you need to set to `url`.
<2> `url` configures to send as `POST` the contract content.

You can set `url` value using Java system property or environment variable by using form `${name:-defaultvalue}`.

==== Git Publisher

Git publisher publishes "pact" files to a git repository.
Optionally they can be committed into a branch or tag the commit.

This publisher just takes the generated "pact" files, copied to repository, commit them and push them to remote.

First of all you need to add git publisher dependency:

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.pact</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-pact-consumer-git-publisher</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
    http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

    <extension qualifier="pact-consumer">
        <property name="pactPublishConfiguration">
            provider: git # <1>
            url: https://localhost:8080/contracts # <2>
            comment: This is a new version of contracts # <3>
            username: admin # <4>
            password: admin
            passphrase: aaaa # <5>
            key: ~/mykey # <6>
            remote: origin # <7>
            repository: /git/myrepo # <8>
            pactDirectory: pacts/ # <9>
            tag: v ${version:-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT} # <10>
            branch: master # <11>
            email: my@email.com # <12>
        </property>
    </extension>

</arquillian>
----
<1> `provider` attribute is used for setting which publisher to use. In case of Git publisher, you need to set to `git`.
<2> `url` sets the git repository. This is mandatory field.
<3> `comment` set comment message. This is mandatory field.
<4> `username` and `password` for accessing repository.
<5> `passphrase` to access to private key.
<6> `key` private key location, by default `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
<7> `remote` repository. By default `origin`.
<8> `repository` sets location of repository. If it is an empty directory, git repository is cloned there. If it is already a git repository, a `git pull` operation is executed. By default a temp directory is created.
<9> `pactDirectory` configures where pact files are stored inside repository. By default gets root directory.
<10> `tag` is used for tagging commit done with new pact files.
<11> `branch` sets a branch where contract files are copied and committed. By default is `master`.
<12> `email` used for commit. By default it gets email from general configuration.

Any of the git attributes can be set using Java system property or environment variable by using form `${name:-defaultvalue}`.

==== SPI

You can also implement your own publisher.
To make it so you need create a class that implements `org.arquillian.pact.consumer.spi.publisher.PactPublisher` and register this service inside `META-INF/services/org.arquillian.pact.consumer.spi.publisher.PactPublisher`.

You can see an example at https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-pact/tree/master/consumer/git-publisher.

=== Arquillian Pact Provider

The next thing you need to do is sent the contract (aka "pact" file) to *Provider* project and validate that provider produces the expected responses to defined requests.
This is done by replaying all requests defined in contract against real provider and validating that the response is the expected one.

==== Loaders

One real important thing in provider tests is where contract files are located and how the test should load it.
To specify this, Arquillian Provider provides some class annotations, but of course you can implement your own as well:

From URL:: `@PactUrl(urls = {"http://build.server/zoo_app-animal_service.json"} )`
From PactBroker:: `@PactBroker(host="${pactbroker.hostname:localhost}", port = "80")`
Notice that in this case system properties with defaults are supported. Also you need to add `org.arquillian.pact:arquillian-pact-provider-pact-broker-loader:${version}` dependency.
From Folder:: `@PactFolder("subfolder/in/resource/directory")`
You can use absolute or relative path. The loader first checks if resource is in classpath and if not checks directory. As with *PactBroker*, you can use system properties.
From Maven:: `@PactMavenDependency(value = "org.superbiz:contract:[1.0,]")`. Also you need to add `org.arquillian.pact:arquillian-pact-provider-maven-loader:${version}` dependency.
In case of specifying a range of versions, this loader will take always the highest one.
You can use system properties to set values too.
From Git:: `@PactGit("https://github.com/lordofthejars/starwarspact.git")` Also you need to add `org.arquillian.pact:arquillian-pact-provider-git-loader:${version}` dependency.
You can use system properties to set vales too. Inspect `@PactGit` annotation for all options that accept this loader such as authentication, use branch or tag or set a pact directory.

It's possible to use a custom Pact source.
For this, implement interface `org.arquillian.pact.provider.spi.loader.PactLoader` and annotate the test class with `@PactSource(MyOwnPactLoader.class)`.

NOTE: class `MyOwnPactLoader` must have a default empty constructor or a constructor with one argument of class Class which at runtime will be the test class so you can get custom annotations of test class.

You can see an example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-pact/blob/master/provider/core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/pact/provider/core/loader/PactUrlLoader.java[PactUrlLoader] java class.

==== Arquillian Pact Provider In Container

Again you can write provider's part using in container or standalone mode.
In this section, an in container mode example is developed.

Apart from adding Arquillian bom dependencies as mentioned in <<arqdeps, consumer part>>, you need to add arquillian pact dependencies:

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.pact</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-pact-provider-core</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <version>${version.arquillian_pact}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>au.com.dius</groupId>
    <artifactId>pact-jvm-provider_2.11</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <version>3.5.0-beta.1</version> <!--1-->
</dependency>
----
<1> Arquillian Pact has been tested with latest version, but it should work with any 3.X version.

After dependencies you can write the test that replies all contracts against provider:

[[provincon]]
[source, java]
.MyServiceProviderTest.java
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@Provider("test_provider") // <1>
@PactFolder("pacts") // <2>
public class MyServiceProviderTest {

    @Deployment(testable = false) // <3>
    public static WebArchive createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class).addClass(MyService.class);
    }

    @ArquillianResource // <4>
    URL webapp;

    @ArquillianResource // <5>
    Target target;

    @Test
    public void should_provide_valid_answers() {
        target.testInteraction(webapp // <6>
                                );
    }

}
----
<1> Sets the name of provider used in this test
<2> Configures where to get pact files
<3> Deploys provider application to app server
<4> Arquillian injection of URL where application is deployed
<5> A target is a class that makes all requests to provider. In case of Arquillian Pact by default it uses an Http Client target
<6> Makes the request to provider and validates that the response is the expected one

When running this test Arquillian Pact Provider will do next things:

. Deploy provider to chosen application server, as any other Arquillian test.
. Read all contract files present in classpath folder `pacts` which the provider is `test_provider`. Of course there can be more than one since a provider might serve several consumers.
. For each contract, it will extract each of the request/response pair
. For each request/response it sends the request specified in contract to provider and validate the response against expectations defined in contract.

So as you can see the `should_provide_valid_answers` might be run several times depending on the number of consumers that depends on provider and the number of requests/responses defined.
But this is something that it is managed automatically by Arquillian Pact.

You can see full example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-pact/tree/master/provider/ftest-incontainer[ftest-incontainer]

==== Arquillian Pact Provider Standalone

The only difference between previous example is that you only need `arquillian-junit-standalone` instead of `arquilian-junit-container` and don't need to define any container adapter.
Obviously no `@Deployment` method is required:

[source, java]
.StarWarsProviderTest
----

@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@Provider("planets_provider")
@PactFolder("pacts")
public class StarWarsProviderTest {

    @ClassRule // <1>
    public static final ClientDriverRule embeddedService = new ClientDriverRule(8332);

    @ArquillianResource
    Target target;

    @BeforeClass // <2>
    public static void recordServerInteractions() {
        embeddedService.addExpectation(
                onRequestTo("/rest/planet/orbital/average")
                    .withMethod(ClientDriverRequest.Method.GET),
                giveResponse("1298.3", "text/plain").withStatus(200));

        embeddedService.addExpectation(
                onRequestTo("/rest/planet/orbital/biggest")
                        .withMethod(ClientDriverRequest.Method.GET),
                giveResponseAsBytes(StarWarsProviderTest.class.getResourceAsStream("/server.json"), "application/json").withStatus(200));

    }


    @Test
    public void validateProvider() {
        target.testInteraction();
    }

}
----

<2> Expectations/Implementation of provider server

You can see full example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-pact/tree/master/provider/ftest[ftest]

==== Arquillian Pact Provider Enrichers

You can enrich your test with current consumer and current request/response interaction by using `@CurrentConsumer` and `CurrentInteraction` annotations.

[source, java]
----
@CurrentConsumer
Consumer consumer;

@CurrentInteraction
RequestResponseInteraction interaction;
----

==== Arquillian Pact Provider Configuration

Arquillian Pact Provider can be configured using Arquillian configuration mechanism (`arquillian.xml` file or system properties).

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
    http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

    <extension qualifier="pact-provider">
        <property name="port">8332</property>
    </extension>

</arquillian>
----

The attributes are:

|===
| Attribute Name | Description | Default Value

|targetUrl
|Url to used by `target` to connect to provider
|

|insecure
|In case of https if test should skip https validations
|false

|protocol
|protocol used to connect in case of not using `targetUrl` property
|http

|host
|host used to connect in case of not using `targetUrl` property
|localhost

|port
|port used to connect in case of not using `targetUrl` property
|8080

|path
|path appended at the end of the host in case of not using `targetUrl` property
|/

|skipDeployment
|skips `@Deployment` methods and does not start/stop container.
|false
|===

Notice that in case of using incontainer tests you don't need to configure any of these parameters (except if _insecure_ is required) since you can use the URL injected by Arquillian.
See this at <<provincon, provider in container>> example.

==== Skipping Deployment

In case of consumer driven contracts, there are two kinds of tests - consumer tests and provider tests.
Usually in your CI environment you want to run provider tests against two different scenarios:

against a master branch of provider:: to detect if provider team has already implemented all the functionalities defined in contracts.
against (pre)production:: if you support deploying consumer independently of a provider, then you need to ensure that if you deploy new consumer with the new contracts to (pre)production everything will be still working and you haven't introduced any regressions.

So before deploying a new consumer you need to verify that from provider side everything will continue working.

In both cases, the test itself is exactly the same.
There is only one slight difference in both cases which how you set up your test environments.
In the first scenario, you want to deploy the latest provider code. One way of doing it is using Arquillian container control and `@Deployment` method to create the package, start the container and deploy it.
But in the latter case, when you want to run contract test against provider that is already deployed on (pre)production environment, you don’t need to deploy anything nor control the lifecycle of any container.
For this reason we provided `skipDeployment` flg.

`skipDeployment` default value by default is set to `false, which means that the test will behave as it usually does, but when it is set to @`true, Arquillian is going to ignore anything related to container lifecycle. `
To use this strategy your test needs to be defined as `@RunAsClient`. You can think of it as a dynamic way of converting an Arquillian container test into Arquillian standalone test.

Let's see an example:

[source, java]
.MyServiceProviderTest.java
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@Provider("test_provider")
@PactFolder("pacts")
@RunAsClient
public class MyServiceProviderTest {

    @Deployment(testable = false)
    public static WebArchive createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class).addClass(MyService.class);
    }

    @ArquillianResource
    @Environment("myservice.url") // <1>
    URL webapp;

    @ArquillianResource
    Target target;

    @Test
    public void should_provide_valid_answers() {
        target.testInteraction(webapp);
    }

}
----
<1> Environment annotation to set URL in case of skipping deployment

Given previous test, if `skipDeployment` is *false*, this test will behave like:

. Start chosen application server (Wildfly, TomEE, Tomcat, ...).
. Package and Deploy `MyService`.
. Enrich `webapp` URL with the one provided by application server.
`@Environment` variable is ignored.
. Executes contract test against deployed application.
. Undeploy and stop everything.

But if you set `skipDeployment` to *true*, lifecycle is slightly different:

. Enrich `webapp` URL with Java system property or environment variable named `myservice.url` set in `@Environment`.
. Executes contract tests against URL provided by `@Environment`.

There is no additional "behind the scenes" Arquillian magic involved.
Notice that with a simple attribute you can enable/disable how Arquillian behaves regarding the deployment lifecycle, and how you can reuse same test (DRY) for different scenarios.

TIP: If you want to enable skipDeployment feature, you can set Java system property or environment variable `arq.extension.pact-provider.SkipDeployment` to true.
