IMPORTANT: Using Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider requires at least Arquillian Core 1.1.12.Final or above.

== What is Arquillian Algeron?

In microservices architecture you typically have one or more services that make remote calls to one or more services to get information from them.

For example you might have one service called _BeerService_ that returns information of a beer.
But this service needs to call another service _CommentsService_ which returns the comments that users has done for given beer.
After _BeerService_ receives all the comments for that beer, everything is packed and sent to the client.

So as you can see there is a communication between both services where one needs to know what and how to send data such as name of fields, type of data or status code (_CommentsService_) and another one that needs to know how to interpret what is received (_BeerService_).

It seems obvious that it must exist some kind of agreement between them so they can understand each other correctly in all of their communications.

=== Consumer Driven Contracts

A *Contract* is a collection of agreements between a client ( or Consumer which in previous example is _BeerService_) and an API (or Provider which in previous example is _CommentsService_) that describes the interactions that can take place between them.

In summary *Consumer Driven Contracts* is a pattern that drives the development of the Provider from its Consumers point of view.
This means that consumer describes what and how he wants to receive the information, describing in form of contract and then provider implements its service following that contract.
When the client validates that can consume what it is been defined in the contract and provider validates that what he produces meets the contract, then you can be sure that contract expectations are met and they will be able to communicate each other.

Also notice that thanks of these tests, if anyone changes the client or the server side to not meet the contract, you'll detect before it is deployed to production.

You can read more about Consumer-Driven contracts http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html[here] or at book https://www.manning.com/books/testing-java-microservices[Testing Java Microservices] chapter 6.

== Arquillian Algeron Pact

Currently Arquillian Algeron only supports one format of contracts (Pact).
But we have plans to extend it to other formats like _swagger_.

https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm[Pact-JVM] is an implementation for JVM languages of Pact.

Arquillian Algeron Pact is the integration of all Arquillian philosophy/extensions into Consumer Driven Contracts approach using Pact-JVM.


https://docs.pact.io/[Pact] is a framework that provides support for Consumer Driven Contracts testing.
Pact is implemented in several languages such as Ruby, JVM, .NET, JavaScript, Go and Swift.

=== How Pact works?

Obviously any Contract test is composed by two faces, one for the consumer and another one for the provider and a contract file that is sent from consumer to provider.
Let's see the steps to write contract tests using Pact.

. Consumer expectations are set up on a mock server.
In this way consumer doesn't need to know how to deploy a provider (since it might not be trivial to do it, and probably at the end you'll end up writing end-to-end tests instead of contract tests).
So consumer tests its client/gateway code to communicate against a mock server.
. When consumer tests are run, mocked requests and responses are written into a "pact" file, which in fact it is the contract that has been defined in consumer part.
. The "pact" file are sent to provider project to be replayed against the provider service.
Then real responses from provider are checked against the expected responses defined in contract.
. If consumer is able to produce a "pact" file and provider meets all the expectations, then you can say that contract is verified by both parties and will be able to communicate.

These steps can be summarized in next diagram:

== Arquillian Algeron Pact Consumer

First thing to do is develop the *Consumer* part of the test.
Consumer part of Consumer-Driven Contract defines requirements from the consumer of the API which are then used to develop the client interaction with the API as well as to validate provider implementation.

=== Arquillian Algeron Pact Consumer Enrichers

You can use in a test `@StubServer` annotation to inject URL where stub http server is started.

[source, java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@Pact(provider="test_provider", consumer="test_consumer")
public class MyTest {

  @StubServer
  URL url;

}
----

=== Arquillian Algeron Pact Consumer In Container

Arquillian has two modes of working *In Container* (which means having a `@Deployment` method) and Arquillian takes care of managing lifecycle of the server and deploy the archive, or *Standalone* (no `@Deployment` method) where Arquillian assumes that everything is already deployed.

Let's see how to write the consumer part in In Container mode.

First thing to do is add typical Arquillian dependencies such as Arquillian bom and the dependency of the container you want to use.
Nothing new here:

----
<1> Notice that I am using Chameleon generic container, you can read more http://www.lordofthejars.com/2016/09/arquillian-chameleon-for-sake-of.html[here].

Then you need to add `arquillian-pact-consumer` dependency as well as `pact-jvm-consumer` dependency:

[source, xml]

    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----
<1> Arquillian Algeron Pact has been tested with latest version, but it should work with any 3.X version.

After dependencies you can write the test that defines the contract:


[[incontainer]]
[source, java]
.ClientGatewayTest.java
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class) // <1>
@Pact(provider="test_provider", consumer="test_consumer") // <2>
public class ClientGatewayTest {

    @Deployment // <3>
    public static JavaArchive createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(JavaArchive.class).addClasses(ClientGateway.class);
    }

    public PactFragment createFragment(PactDslWithProvider builder) {

        Map<String, String> header = new HashMap<>();
        header.put("Content-Type", "application/json");

        return builder
                .given("test state")
                .uponReceiving("ConsumerTest test interaction")
                .path("/")
                .method("GET")
                .willRespondWith()
                .status(200)
                .headers(header)
                .body("{\"responsetest\": true, \"name\": \"harry\"}")
                .toFragment(); // <4>
    }

    @EJB // <5>
    ClientGateway clientGateway;

    @StubServer // <6>
    URL url;

    @Test
    @PactVerification("test_provider") // <7>
    public void should_return_message() throws IOException {
        assertThat(clientGateway.getMessage(url), is("{\"responsetest\": true, \"name\": \"harry\"}")); // <8>
    }
}
----
<1> Arquillian Runner
<2> To define the contract you need to configure expectations of mock server. This is done by annotating a method or class with `@Pact` annotation and setting the provider and consumer name
<3> Defines what you want to deploy to defined container. In this case an EJB that acts as gateway to another service
<4> A Pact method returns a fragment of the contract which might be the complete contract or not
<5> Typical Arquillian enrichment
<6> `@StubServer` annotation is used for enrich test with stub http server Url.
<7> Defines which provider is validated when this test method is executed.
<8> Asserts that the gateway can read the kind of messages sent by provider. Notice that now it is pretty simple, but in real test you'll test for example that message is correctly bound to an object.

After this test is executed, contract is placed at `target/pacts` directory.
Then you can send contract to provider side.

Notice that contract and/or mock responses are defined using Pact DSL.
You can read more about this DSL at https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm/tree/master/pact-jvm-consumer-junit#using-the-pact-dsl-directly[Using the Pact DSL directly].

Important things to retain from consumer part:

* It is an Arquillian test so you can use anything that Arquillian provides.
* Methods or classes annotated with `@Pact` defines a fragment of the contract that at same time is used by mock server for providing responses.
* In case of using several methods annotated with `@Pact` annotation, you need to use `fragment` attribute `@PactVerification(.. fragment="methodName")`to set which fragment is under test for each `@Test` method.

TIP: You can use `@Pact` annotation at class level, so methods that defines a pact fragment, just need to return `PactFragment` class. Information will be picked from class level. In case of setting annotation at class and method level too, the one defined on the method will take precedence.

You can see the full example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-algeron/tree/master/pact/consumer/ftest-container[ftest-incontainer]

=== Arquillian Algeron Pact Consumer Standalone

*Standalone* mode (no `@Deployment` method), Arquillian assumes that everything is already deployed.

The only difference between previous example is that you only need `arquillian-junit-standalone` instead of `arquilian-junit-container` and don't need to define any container adapter.
Obviously no `@Deployment` method is required:

[source, java]
.ConsumerTest.java
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class ConsumerTest {

    @Pact(provider = "test_provider", consumer = "test_consumer")
    public PactFragment createFragment(PactDslWithProvider builder) {

        Map<String, String> header = new HashMap<>();
        header.put("Content-Type", "application/json");

        return builder
                .given("test state")
                .uponReceiving("ConsumerTest test interaction")
                .path("/")
                .method("GET")
                .willRespondWith()
                .status(200)
                .headers(header)
                .body("{\"responsetest\": true, \"name\": \"harry\"}")
                .toFragment();
    }

    @StubServer
    URL url;

    @Test
    @PactVerification("test_provider")
    public void runTest() throws IOException {
        new ConsumerClient().get(url).body("name", equalTo("harry"));
        assertThat(new File("target/pacts/test_consumer-test_provider.json")).exists();
    }

}
----

Code is pretty similar as <<incontainer, previous test>> but now the consumer client/gateway object is instantiated as plain java object instead of container managed.

You can see the full example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-algeron/tree/master/pact/consumer/ftest[ftest]

=== Arquillian Algeron Pact Consumer Configuration

Arquillian Algeron Pact Consumer can be configured using Arquillian configuration mechanism (`arquillian.xml` file or system properties).

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
    http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

    <extension qualifier="pact-consumer">
        <property name="pactSpecVersion">1</property>
    </extension>

</arquillian>
----

The attributes are:

|===
| Attribute Name | Description | Default Value

|host
|Bind host for mock server
|localhost

|port
|Listening port for mock server
|9090

|pactSpecVesion
|Pact specification version as integer
|3

|https
|If mock server should start using https instead of http
|false

|provider
|If you want to set provider globally
|

|pactArtifactVersion
|By default Arquillian Algeron Pact packages pact dependencies in container tests. To get the version of artifacts to package, checks the current pact version of classpath.
 If you want to use another one rather the one defined in your classpath, you can set it here the version.
|

|pactReportDir
|Directory where contracts are stored.
|target/pacts
|===

== Arquillian Algeron Consumer Publisher

Arquillian Algeron also offers additional ways to of publishing contracts files comparing to what Pact itself is providing.

In Arquillian Algeron we have defined a Pact Publishing SPI so you can implement your own publisher.
We currently support three different publishers - Folder, URL[POST method] and Git.

It is important to note that by default `publishContracts` configuration attribute is `false`.
This means that when you run any consumer contract test, contracts are not published.
`publishContracts` configuration attribute should be only set to `true`if and only if you are publishing a new version of a consumer, and this will be done by your CI/CD environment.

[TIP]
====
Arquillian can be configured using system properties or environment variables.
If you want to enable pact publishing feature only in CI/CD, you can set environment variable `arq.extension.algeron-consumer.publishContracts` to true.
Also you can use the form `<property name="publishContracts">${env.publishcontracts:false}</property>` and setting `publishContracts` environment variable with correct value.
====

=== Folder Publisher

Folder publisher copies "pact" files from configured output directory (by default `target/pacts`) to another directory.
To configure folder publisher you need to configure `pactPublishConfiguration` with next configuration:

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
    http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

    <extension qualifier="algeron-consumer">
        <property name="publishConfiguration">
            provider: folder # <1>
            outputFolder: /mypacts # <2>
            contractsFolder: target/pacts # <3>
        </property>
    </extension>

</arquillian>
----
<1> `provider` attribute is used for setting which publisher to use. In case of Folder publisher, you need to set to `folder`.
<2> `outputFolder` configures where to copy contract files.
<3> `contractsFolder` configures folder where contract files are generated by the engine.

You can set `outputFolder` value using Java system property `${name:defaultvalue} or environment variable `${env.name:defaultvalue}.
For example `outputFolder: ${output:/mypacts}` will first check if there is a Java system property with name output and get the value.
If that is not defined it will use the default value i.e. `/mypacts`.

=== URL Publisher

URL publisher sends a `POST` request to configured URL, appending at the end of the URL the "pact" filename and sending the contract content as body content.
For example given `http://myhost/pacts` and a "contract" file called `consumer_provider.json`, the resulting URL would be: `http://myhost/pacts/consumer_provider.json`

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
    http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

    <extension qualifier="algeron-consumer">
        <property name="publishConfiguration">
            provider: url # <1>
            url: http://localhost:8081/pacts # <2>
            contractsFolder: target/pacts # <3>
        </property>
    </extension>

</arquillian>
----
<1> `provider` attribute is used for setting which publisher to use. In case of URL publisher, you need to set to `url`.
<2> `url` configures to send as `POST` the contract content.
<3> `contractsFolder` configures folder where contract files are generated by the engine.

You can set `url` value using Java system property `${name:defaultvalue}` or environment variable `${env.name:defaultvalue}`.

=== Git Publisher

Git publisher publishes contract files to a git repository.
Optionally they can be committed into a branch or tag the commit.

This publisher just takes the generated contract files, copied to repository, commit them and push them to remote.

First of all you need to add git publisher dependency:

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.algeron</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-algeron-consumer-git-publisher</artifactId>

----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
    http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

    <extension qualifier="algeron-consumer">
        <property name="publishConfiguration">
            provider: git # <1>
            url: https://localhost:8080/contracts # <2>
            comment: This is a new version of contracts # <3>
            username: admin # <4>
            password: admin
            passphrase: aaaa # <5>
            key: ~/mykey # <6>
            remote: origin # <7>
            repository: /git/myrepo # <8>
            contractGitDirectory: pacts/ # <9>
            tag: v ${version:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT} # <10>
            branch: master # <11>
            email: my@email.com # <12>
            contractsFolder: target/pacts # <13>
        </property>
    </extension>

</arquillian>
----
<1> `provider` attribute is used for setting which publisher to use. In case of Git publisher, you need to set to `git`.
<2> `url` sets the git repository. This is mandatory field.
<3> `comment` set comment message. This is mandatory field.
<4> `username` and `password` for accessing repository.
<5> `passphrase` to access to private key.
<6> `key` private key location, by default `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
<7> `remote` repository. By default `origin`.
<8> `repository` sets location of repository. If it is an empty directory, git repository is cloned there. If it is already a git repository, a `git pull` operation is executed. By default a temp directory is created.
<9> `pactDirectory` configures where pact files are stored inside repository. By default gets root directory.
<10> `tag` is used for tagging commit done with new pact files.
<11> `branch` sets a branch where contract files are copied and committed. By default is `master`.
<12> `email` used for commit. By default it gets email from general configuration.
<13> `contractsFolder` configures folder where contract files are generated by the engine.

Any of the git attributes can be set using Java system property `${name:defaultvalue}` or environment variable `${env.name:defaultvalue}`.

=== SPI

You can also implement your own publisher.
To make it so you need create a class that implements `org.arquillian.algeron.consumer.spi.publisher.ContractsPublisher` and register this service inside `META-INF/services/org.arquillian.algeron.consumer.spi.publisher.ContractsPublisher`.

You can see an example at https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-algeron/tree/master/consumer/git-publisher.

== Arquillian Algeron Provider

=== Retrievers as Annotation

One real important thing in provider tests is where contract files are located and how the test should load it.
To specify this, Arquillian Provider provides some class annotations, but of course you can implement your own as well:

From URL:: `@ContractsUrl(urls = {"http://build.server/zoo_app-animal_service.json"} )`
From PactBroker:: `@PactBroker(host="${pactbroker.hostname:localhost}", port = "80")`
Notice that in this case system properties with defaults are supported. Also you need to add `org.arquillian.algeron:arquillian-algeron-pact-provider-pact-broker-loader:${version}` dependency. This is only supported in case of using Pact provider.
From Folder:: `@ContractsFolder("subfolder/in/resource/directory")`
You can use absolute or relative path. The loader first checks if resource is in classpath and if not checks directory. As with *PactBroker*, you can use system properties.
From Maven:: `@ContractsMavenDependency(value = "org.superbiz:contract:[1.0,]")`. Also you need to add `org.arquillian.algeron:arquillian-algeron-provider-maven-retriever:${version}` dependency.
In case of specifying a range of versions, this loader will take always the highest one.
You can use system properties to set values too.
From Git:: `@ContractsGit("https://github.com/lordofthejars/starwarspact.git")` Also you need to add `org.arquillian.algeron:arquillian-algeron-provider-git-retriever:${version}` dependency.
You can use system properties to set vales too. Inspect `@ContractsGit` annotation for all options that accept this loader such as authentication, use branch or tag or set a pact directory.

It's possible to use a custom Contracts retriever.
For this, implement interface `ContractsRetriever` and annotate the test class with `@ContractSource(MyOwnRetriever.class)`.

NOTE: class `MyOwnRetriever` must have a default empty constructor or a constructor with one argument of class Class which at runtime will be the test class so you can get custom annotations of test class.

You can see an example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-algeron/blob/master/provider/core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/algeron/provider/core/retriever/ContractsUrlLoader.java[ContractsUrlLoader] java class.

=== Retrievers as Configuration

As it happens with consumer part, Arquillian Algeron allows you to configure retrievers in `arquillian.xml`.

==== Folder Retriever

You can retrieve contracts from folder:

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
  <property name="retrieverConfiguration">
          provider: folder
          contractsFolder: <folder where contracts are stored>
    </property>
</extension>
----

==== URL Retriever

You can retrieve contracts from URL/s.

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
  <property name="retrieverConfiguration">
          provider: url
          url: url where contract is stored # <1>
    </property>
</extension>
----
<1> url where contracts are stored (this can be in form of string or yml list)

==== Git Retriever

You can retrieve contracts from Git repository.

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
  <property name="retrieverConfiguration">
          provider: git
          url: <giturl>
          username: username
          password: password
  </property>
</extension>
----

Also you need to add `org.arquillian.algeron:arquillian-algeron-provider-git-retriever:${version}` dependency.

Possible attributes:

|===
| Parameter | Description

|url
|Mandatory field that sets git server url.

|username
|Optional field that sets the username to access to git repository.

|password
|Optional field that sets the password to access to git repository.

|passphrase
|Optional field that sets the passphrase to open the private key.

|remote
|Optional field that sets the remote name (algeron uses origin by default)

|key
|Optional field that sets the private key location. (Algeron uses ~/.ssh/id_rsa by default)

|repository
|Optional field that sets local location of git repository.

|contractGitRepository
|Optional field that sets inner folder where contracts are stored.

|tag
|Optional field that checkouts given tag

|branch
|Optional field that checkouts given branch
|===

Notice that all these attributes can be set using system properties or environment variable as any other property in `arquillian.xml` such as:

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
  <property name="retrieverConfiguration">
          provider: git
          url: <giturl>
          username: username
          password: ${env.username}
  </property>
</extension>
----

==== Maven Retriever

You can retrieve contracts from Maven artifacts.

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
  <property name="retrieverConfiguration">
          provider: maven
          coordinates: <coordinates of artifact>
  </property>
</extension>
----

Also you need to add `org.arquillian.algeron:arquillian-algeron-provider-maven-retriever:${version}` dependency.

Possible attributes:

|===
| Parameter | Description

|coordinates
|Mandatory Maven coordinates of contracts. G:A:V format.

|offline
|Optional flag that sets Maven to work offline.

|customSettings
|Optional field that sets the location of custom settings.xml file.

|remoteRepository
|Optional field that sets URL of remote Maven repository
|===

Notice that all these attributes can be set using system properties or environment variable as any other property in `arquillian.xml`.

==== Pact Broker Retriever

You can retrieve contracts from Pact Broker artifacts.

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
  <property name="retrieverConfiguration">
          provider: pactbroker
          host: <host of pact broker server>
          port: <port of pact broker server>
  </property>
</extension>
----

Also you need to add `org.arquillian.algeron:arquillian-algeron-pact-provider-pact-broker-loader:${version}` dependency. This is only supported in case of using Pact provider.

Possible attributes:

|===
| Parameter | Description

|host
|Mandatory field that sets host of Pact Broker.

|port
|Mandatory field that sets the port of Pact Broker.

|protocol
|Optional field that sets protocol used. By default Algeron uses http.

|tags
|Optional field that sets the tags to retrieve from Pact Broker.
|===

Notice that all these attributes can be set using system properties or environment variable as any other property in `arquillian.xml`.

=== Skipping Deployment

In case of consumer driven contracts, there are two kinds of tests - consumer tests and provider tests.
Usually in your CI environment you want to run provider tests against two different scenarios:

against a master branch of provider:: to detect if provider team has already implemented all the functionalities defined in contracts.
against (pre)production:: if you support deploying consumer independently of a provider, then you need to ensure that if you deploy new consumer with the new contracts to (pre)production everything will be still working and you haven't introduced any regressions.

So before deploying a new consumer you need to verify that from provider side everything will continue working.

In both cases, the test itself is exactly the same.
There is only one slight difference in both cases which how you set up your test environments.
In the first scenario, you want to deploy the latest provider code. One way of doing it is using Arquillian container control and `@Deployment` method to create the package, start the container and deploy it.
But in the latter case, when you want to run contract test against provider that is already deployed on (pre)production environment, you don’t need to deploy anything nor control the lifecycle of any container.
For this reason we provided `skipDeployment` flag.

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
    <property name="skipDeployment">${env.skipDeployment:false}</property>
</extension>
----

`skipDeployment` default value by default is set to `false, which means that the test will behave as it usually does, but when it is set to @`true, Arquillian is going to ignore anything related to container lifecycle. `
To use this strategy your test needs to be defined as `@RunAsClient`. You can think of it as a dynamic way of converting an Arquillian container test into Arquillian standalone test.

Let's see an example:

[source, java]
.MyServiceProviderTest.java
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@Provider("test_provider")
@PactFolder("pacts")
@RunAsClient
public class MyServiceProviderTest {

    @Deployment(testable = false)
    public static WebArchive createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class).addClass(MyService.class);
    }

    @ArquillianResource
    @Environment("myservice.url") // <1>
    URL webapp;

    @ArquillianResource
    Target target;

    @Test
    public void should_provide_valid_answers() {
        target.testInteraction(webapp);
    }

}
----
<1> Environment annotation to set URL in case of skipping deployment

Given previous test, if `skipDeployment` is *false*, this test will behave like:

. Start chosen application server (Wildfly, TomEE, Tomcat, ...).
. Package and Deploy `MyService`.
. Enrich `webapp` URL with the one provided by application server.
`@Environment` variable is ignored.
. Executes contract test against deployed application.
. Undeploy and stop everything.

But if you set `skipDeployment` to *true*, lifecycle is slightly different:

. Enrich `webapp` URL with Java system property or environment variable named `myservice.url` set in `@Environment`.
. Executes contract tests against URL provided by `@Environment`.

There is no additional "behind the scenes" Arquillian magic involved.
Notice that with a simple attribute you can enable/disable how Arquillian behaves regarding the deployment lifecycle, and how you can reuse same test (DRY) for different scenarios.

TIP: If you want to enable skipDeployment feature, you can set Java system property or environment variable `arq.extension.algeron-provider.SkipDeployment` to true or by using `${env.skipDeployment:false}` form.

=== Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider

The next thing you need to do is sent the contract (aka "pact" file) to *Provider* project and validate that provider produces the expected responses to defined requests.
This is done by replaying all requests defined in contract against real provider and validating that the response is the expected one.

==== Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider In Container

Again you can write provider's part using in container or standalone mode.
In this section, an in container mode example is developed.

Apart from adding Arquillian bom dependencies as mentioned in <<arqdeps, consumer part>>, you need to add arquillian algeron pact dependencies:

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.algeron</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-algeron-pact-provider-core</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <version>${version.arquillian_algeron}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>au.com.dius</groupId>
    <artifactId>pact-jvm-provider_2.11</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <version>3.5.0-beta.2</version> <!--1-->
</dependency>
----
<1> Arquillian Algeron Pact has been tested with latest version, but it should work with any 3.X version.

After dependencies you can write the test that replies all contracts against provider:

[[provincon]]
[source, java]
.MyServiceProviderTest.java
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@Provider("test_provider") // <1>
@PactFolder("pacts") // <2>
public class MyServiceProviderTest {

    @Deployment(testable = false) // <3>
    public static WebArchive createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class).addClass(MyService.class);
    }

    @ArquillianResource // <4>
    URL webapp;

    @ArquillianResource // <5>
    Target target;

    @Test
    public void should_provide_valid_answers() {
        target.testInteraction(webapp); // <6>
    }

}
----
<1> Sets the name of provider used in this test
<2> Configures where to get pact files
<3> Deploys provider application to app server
<4> Arquillian injection of URL where application is deployed
<5> A target is a class that makes all requests to provider. In case of Arquillian Algeron Pact by default it uses an Http Client target
<6> Makes the request to provider and validates that the response is the expected one

When running this test Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider will do next things:

. Deploy provider to chosen application server, as any other Arquillian test.
. Read all contract files present in classpath folder `pacts` which the provider is `test_provider`. Of course there can be more than one since a provider might serve several consumers.
. For each contract, it will extract each of the request/response pair
. For each request/response it sends the request specified in contract to provider and validate the response against expectations defined in contract.

So as you can see the `should_provide_valid_answers` might be run several times depending on the number of consumers that depends on provider and the number of requests/responses defined.
But this is something that it is managed automatically by Arquillian Algeron Pact.

You can see full example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-algeron/tree/master/pact/provider/ftest-container[ftest-incontainer]

==== Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider Standalone

The only difference between previous example is that you only need `arquillian-junit-standalone` instead of `arquilian-junit-container` and don't need to define any container adapter.
Obviously no `@Deployment` method is required:

[source, java]
.StarWarsProviderTest
----

@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@Provider("planets_provider")
@PactFolder("pacts")
public class StarWarsProviderTest {

    @ClassRule // <1>
    public static final ClientDriverRule embeddedService = new ClientDriverRule(8332);

    @ArquillianResource
    Target target;

    @BeforeClass // <2>
    public static void recordServerInteractions() {
        embeddedService.addExpectation(
                onRequestTo("/rest/planet/orbital/average")
                    .withMethod(ClientDriverRequest.Method.GET),
                giveResponse("1298.3", "text/plain").withStatus(200));

        embeddedService.addExpectation(
                onRequestTo("/rest/planet/orbital/biggest")
                        .withMethod(ClientDriverRequest.Method.GET),
                giveResponseAsBytes(StarWarsProviderTest.class.getResourceAsStream("/server.json"), "application/json").withStatus(200));

    }


    @Test
    public void validateProvider() {
        target.testInteraction();
    }

}
----
<1> Stub server to not having to having to deploy an application
<2> Expectations/Implementation of provider server

You can see full example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-algeron/tree/master/pact/provider/ftest[ftest]

==== Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider Enrichers

You can enrich your test with current consumer and current request/response interaction by using `@CurrentConsumer` and `CurrentInteraction` annotations.

[source, java]
----
@CurrentConsumer
Consumer consumer;

@CurrentInteraction
RequestResponseInteraction interaction;
----

==== Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider Configuration

Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider can be configured using Arquillian configuration mechanism (`arquillian.xml` file or system properties).

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
    http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

    <extension qualifier="pact-provider">
        <property name="port">8332</property>
    </extension>

</arquillian>
----

The attributes are:

|===
| Attribute Name | Description | Default Value

|targetUrl
|Url to used by `target` to connect to provider
|

|insecure
|In case of https if test should skip https validations
|false

|protocol
|protocol used to connect in case of not using `targetUrl` property
|http

|host
|host used to connect in case of not using `targetUrl` property
|localhost

|port
|port used to connect in case of not using `targetUrl` property
|8080

|path
|path appended at the end of the host in case of not using `targetUrl` property
|/

|===

Notice that in case of using incontainer tests you don't need to configure any of these parameters (except if _insecure_ is required) since you can use the URL injected by Arquillian.
See this at <<provincon, provider in container>> example.

==== Pact States

Each interaction in a pact should be verified in isolation, with no context maintained from the previous interactions.
Provider states allow you to set up data on the provider by injecting it straight into the datasource before the interaction is run, so that it can make a response that matches what the consumer expects.

Provider states also allow the consumer to make the same request with different expected responses.

Provider state is all about the state of the provider, not about the state of the consumer, or about what is in the request.

In consumer side you set an state using `given` section.

For example:

`builder.given("test state")...` sets state as plain String.

Or in case you want to set some parameters you can do:

[source, java]
----
Map parameters = new HashMap<>();
builder.given("test state", parameters)...
----

which in this case sets an state name with some key/value pairs.

But in *Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider* we also give support for states in the form of _Cucumber_ expression.
You can define an state with the form:

`builder.given("I have 36 cukes in my belly")...`

So the next question is how can I respond to states in provider side?
Let's see an example in each case:

In first example you only set a state with a name, without any parameter, so in your provider side you are going to do:

[source, java]
----
@State("test state")
public void testStateMethod(Map<String, Object> params) {
    // Do some data preparation
}
----

This method is executed if and only if given interaction has defined the state `test state`.

Obviously in previous example you have no way to pass parameters from consumer to provider.
In second example you are passing a map with some parameters.
To recover them you need to add as method parameter a `Map`.

[source, java]
----
@State("test state")
public void testStateMethod(Map<String, Object> params) {
}
----

This method is executed if and only if given interaction has defined the state `test state` and injects the defined parameters in consumer as method parameter.

Also the third case uses Cucumber-lik expression, so you need similar way to take parameters.

[source, java]
----
@State("I have (\\d+) cukes in my belly")
public void stateMethod(int numberOfCukes) {
    this.numberOfCukes = numberOfCukes;
}
----

Notice that now as happens with Cucumber you need to specify the regular expression and you get the values as method parameters.
Native values and list are supported.
Lists are set in consumer side as comma-separated values and scanned as `\\s+`.

==== AssertJ integration

Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider implements custom matcher of AssertJ for validating contracts against provider.

First thing to do to use AssertJ matcher is add `arquillian-algeron-pact-provider-assertj` dependency, and the *AssertJ* you want to use.

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.algeron</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-algeron-pact-provider-assertj</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.assertj</groupId>
    <artifactId>assertj-core</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Finally in your test you can use the overloaded `assertThat` static method receiving a `Target` type.

[source, java]
----
@ArquillianResource
URL webapp;

@ArquillianResource
Target target;

@Test
public void should_provide_valid_answers() {
    assertThat(target).withUrl(webapp).satisfiesContract();
}
----

Notice that now instead of writing `target.testInteraction(webapp);` you are using a more readable way of asserting test.

==== Arquillian Recorder Reporter integration

Currently pact generates report from contract tests in several formats, including Markdown or JSON.
You can also report using Arquillian Recorder Reporter (https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-recorder) extension.

To use it you need to annotate at test class level with `VerificationReports` and set type to `recorder` and add Arquillian Recorder Reporter dependency `org.arquillian.extension:arquillian-recorder-reporter-impl:<version>`.

TIP: you can set more than reporter at once so you can do `@VerificationReports(value = {"console", "recorder"})`.
