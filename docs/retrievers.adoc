= Retrievers

== Retrievers as Annotation

One real important thing in provider tests is where contract files are located and how the test should load it.
To specify this, Arquillian Provider provides some class annotations, but of course you can implement your own as well:

From URL:: `@ContractsUrl(urls = {"http://build.server/zoo_app-animal_service.json"} )`
From PactBroker:: `@PactBroker(url="${pactbroker.hostname:localhost}")`
Notice that in this case system properties with defaults are supported. Also you need to add `org.arquillian.algeron:arquillian-algeron-pact-provider-pact-broker-loader:${version}` dependency. This is only supported in case of using Pact provider.
From Folder:: `@ContractsFolder("subfolder/in/resource/directory")`
You can use absolute or relative path. The loader first checks if resource is in classpath and if not checks directory. As with *PactBroker*, you can use system properties.
From Maven:: `@ContractsMavenDependency(value = "org.superbiz:contract:[1.0,]")`. Also you need to add `org.arquillian.algeron:arquillian-algeron-provider-maven-retriever:${version}` dependency.
In case of specifying a range of versions, this loader will take always the highest one.
You can use system properties to set values too.
From Git:: `@ContractsGit("https://github.com/lordofthejars/starwarspact.git")` Also you need to add `org.arquillian.algeron:arquillian-algeron-provider-git-retriever:${version}` dependency.
You can use system properties to set vales too. Inspect `@ContractsGit` annotation for all options that accept this loader such as authentication, use branch or tag or set a pact directory.

It's possible to use a custom Contracts retriever.
For this, implement interface `ContractsRetriever` and annotate the test class with `@ContractSource(MyOwnRetriever.class)`.

NOTE: class `MyOwnRetriever` must have a default empty constructor or a constructor with one argument of class Class which at runtime will be the test class so you can get custom annotations of test class.

You can see an example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-algeron/blob/master/provider/core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/algeron/provider/core/retriever/ContractsUrlLoader.java[ContractsUrlLoader] java class.

== Retrievers as Configuration

As it happens with consumer part, Arquillian Algeron allows you to configure retrievers in `arquillian.xml`.

=== Folder Retriever

You can retrieve contracts from folder:

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
  <property name="retrieverConfiguration">
          provider: folder
          contractsFolder: <folder where contracts are stored>
    </property>
</extension>
----

=== URL Retriever

You can retrieve contracts from URL/s.

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
  <property name="retrieverConfiguration">
          provider: url
          url: url where contract is stored # <1>
    </property>
</extension>
----
<1> url where contracts are stored (this can be in form of string or yml list)

=== Git Retriever

You can retrieve contracts from Git repository.

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
  <property name="retrieverConfiguration">
          provider: git
          url: <giturl>
          username: username
          password: password
  </property>
</extension>
----

Also you need to add `org.arquillian.algeron:arquillian-algeron-provider-git-retriever:${version}` dependency.

Possible attributes:

|===
| Parameter | Description

|url
|Mandatory field that sets git server url.

|username
|Optional field that sets the username to access to git repository.

|password
|Optional field that sets the password to access to git repository.

|passphrase
|Optional field that sets the passphrase to open the private key.

|remote
|Optional field that sets the remote name (algeron uses origin by default)

|key
|Optional field that sets the private key location. (Algeron uses ~/.ssh/id_rsa by default)

|repository
|Optional field that sets local location of git repository.

|contractGitRepository
|Optional field that sets inner folder where contracts are stored.

|tag
|Optional field that checkouts given tag

|branch
|Optional field that checkouts given branch
|===

Notice that all these attributes can be set using system properties or environment variable as any other property in `arquillian.xml` such as:

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
  <property name="retrieverConfiguration">
          provider: git
          url: <giturl>
          username: username
          password: ${env.username}
  </property>
</extension>
----

=== Maven Retriever

You can retrieve contracts from Maven artifacts.

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
  <property name="retrieverConfiguration">
          provider: maven
          coordinates: <coordinates of artifact>
  </property>
</extension>
----

Also you need to add `org.arquillian.algeron:arquillian-algeron-provider-maven-retriever:${version}` dependency.

Possible attributes:

|===
| Parameter | Description

|coordinates
|Mandatory Maven coordinates of contracts. G:A:V format.

|offline
|Optional flag that sets Maven to work offline.

|customSettings
|Optional field that sets the location of custom settings.xml file.

|remoteRepository
|Optional field that sets URL of remote Maven repository
|===

Notice that all these attributes can be set using system properties or environment variable as any other property in `arquillian.xml`.

=== Pact Broker Retriever

You can retrieve contracts from Pact Broker artifacts.

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="algeron-provider">
  <property name="retrieverConfiguration">
          provider: pactbroker
          url: <url of pact broker server>
          username: <username of pact borker>
          password: <password of pact broker>
          tags: <tag or list of tags
  </property>
</extension>
----

Also you need to add `org.arquillian.algeron:arquillian-algeron-pact-provider-pact-broker-loader:${version}` dependency. This is only supported in case of using Pact provider.

Possible attributes:

|===
| Parameter | Description

|url
|Mandatory field that sets url of Pact Broker.

|username
|Optional field that sets the username of Pact Broker.

|password
|Optional field that sets the password of Pact Broker.

|tags
|Optional field that sets the tags to retrieve from Pact Broker or latest by default.
|===

Notice that all these attributes can be set using system properties or environment variable as any other property in `arquillian.xml`.

== JBoss Forge Arquillian Addon

http://forge.jboss.org[Forge] Arquillian Addon offers an integration with Arquillian Algeron Retrievers.

To use it apart from having the Forge Arquillian Addon installed in Forge, you also need to have Arquillian Algeron Provider dependencies registered on build tool (for example using command `arquillian-algeron-setup-provider --contracts-library pact` <<JBoss_Forge_Arquillian_Algeron_Provider_Addon, JBoss Forge Arquillian Provider Addon>> ).

Each of the publishers have its own command to be registered where you can set its specific configuration parameters.

folder:: `arquillian-algeron-setup-retriever --retriever folder --contract-folder /tmp`
url:: `arquillian-algeron-setup-retriever --retriever url --url http://localhost`
git:: `arquillian-algeron-setup-retriever --retriever git --url http://localhost:3000`
maven:: `arquillian-algeron-setup-retriever --retriever maven --maven-coordinates org.superbiz:foo:1.0.0`
pactbroker:: `arquillian-algeron-setup-retriever --retriever pactbroker --host http://localhost --port 8081`

See it alive in next terminal cast:
