= Arquillian Algeron Pact

Currently Arquillian Algeron only supports one format of contracts (Pact).
But we have plans to extend it to other formats like _swagger_.

https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm[Pact-JVM] is an implementation for JVM languages of Pact.

Arquillian Algeron Pact is the integration of all Arquillian philosophy/extensions into Consumer Driven Contracts approach using Pact-JVM.


https://docs.pact.io/[Pact] is a framework that provides support for Consumer Driven Contracts testing.
Pact is implemented in several languages such as Ruby, JVM, .NET, JavaScript, Go and Swift.

== How Pact works?

Obviously any Contract test is composed by two faces, one for the consumer and another one for the provider and a contract file that is sent from consumer to provider.
Let's see the steps to write contract tests using Pact.

. Consumer expectations are set up on a mock server.
In this way consumer doesn't need to know how to deploy a provider (since it might not be trivial to do it, and probably at the end you'll end up writing end-to-end tests instead of contract tests).
So consumer tests its client/gateway code to communicate against a mock server.
. When consumer tests are run, mocked requests and responses are written into a "pact" file, which in fact it is the contract that has been defined in consumer part.
. The "pact" file are sent to provider project to be replayed against the provider service.
Then real responses from provider are checked against the expected responses defined in contract.
. If consumer is able to produce a "pact" file and provider meets all the expectations, then you can say that contract is verified by both parties and will be able to communicate.

These steps can be summarized in next diagram:
