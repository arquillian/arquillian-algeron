= Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider

The next thing you need to do is sent the contract (aka "pact" file) to *Provider* project and validate that provider produces the expected responses to defined requests.
This is done by replaying all requests defined in contract against real provider and validating that the response is the expected one.

== Pact Provider In Container

Again you can write provider's part using in container or standalone mode.
In this section, an in container mode example is developed.

Apart from adding Arquillian bom dependencies as mentioned in <<arqdeps, consumer part>>, you need to add arquillian algeron pact dependencies:

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.algeron</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-algeron-pact-provider-core</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <version>${version.arquillian_algeron}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>au.com.dius</groupId>
    <artifactId>pact-jvm-provider_2.11</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <version>3.5.0-beta.2</version> <!--1-->
</dependency>
----
<1> Arquillian Algeron Pact has been tested with latest version, but it should work with any 3.X version.

After dependencies you can write the test that replies all contracts against provider:

[[provincon]]
[source, java]
.MyServiceProviderTest.java
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@Provider("test_provider") // <1>
@PactFolder("pacts") // <2>
public class MyServiceProviderTest {

    @Deployment(testable = false) // <3>
    public static WebArchive createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class).addClass(MyService.class);
    }

    @ArquillianResource // <4>
    URL webapp;

    @ArquillianResource // <5>
    Target target;

    @Test
    public void should_provide_valid_answers() {
        target.testInteraction(webapp); // <6>
    }

}
----
<1> Sets the name of provider used in this test
<2> Configures where to get pact files
<3> Deploys provider application to app server
<4> Arquillian injection of URL where application is deployed
<5> A target is a class that makes all requests to provider. In case of Arquillian Algeron Pact by default it uses an Http Client target
<6> Makes the request to provider and validates that the response is the expected one

When running this test Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider will do next things:

. Deploy provider to chosen application server, as any other Arquillian test.
. Read all contract files present in classpath folder `pacts` which the provider is `test_provider`. Of course there can be more than one since a provider might serve several consumers.
. For each contract, it will extract each of the request/response pair
. For each request/response it sends the request specified in contract to provider and validate the response against expectations defined in contract.

So as you can see the `should_provide_valid_answers` might be run several times depending on the number of consumers that depends on provider and the number of requests/responses defined.
But this is something that it is managed automatically by Arquillian Algeron Pact.

You can see full example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-algeron/tree/master/pact/provider/ftest-container[ftest-incontainer]

== Pact Provider Standalone

The only difference between previous example is that you only need `arquillian-junit-standalone` instead of `arquilian-junit-container` and don't need to define any container adapter.
Obviously no `@Deployment` method is required:

[source, java]
.StarWarsProviderTest
----

@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@Provider("planets_provider")
@PactFolder("pacts")
public class StarWarsProviderTest {

    @ClassRule // <1>
    public static final ClientDriverRule embeddedService = new ClientDriverRule(8332);

    @ArquillianResource
    Target target;

    @BeforeClass // <2>
    public static void recordServerInteractions() {
        embeddedService.addExpectation(
                onRequestTo("/rest/planet/orbital/average")
                    .withMethod(ClientDriverRequest.Method.GET),
                giveResponse("1298.3", "text/plain").withStatus(200));

        embeddedService.addExpectation(
                onRequestTo("/rest/planet/orbital/biggest")
                        .withMethod(ClientDriverRequest.Method.GET),
                giveResponseAsBytes(StarWarsProviderTest.class.getResourceAsStream("/server.json"), "application/json").withStatus(200));

    }


    @Test
    public void validateProvider() {
        target.testInteraction();
    }

}

<2> Expectations/Implementation of provider server

You can see full example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-algeron/tree/master/pact/provider/ftest[ftest]

== Pact Provider Enrichers

You can enrich your test with current consumer and current request/response interaction by using `@CurrentConsumer` and `CurrentInteraction` annotations.

[source, java]
----
@CurrentConsumer
Consumer consumer;

@CurrentInteraction
RequestResponseInteraction interaction;
----

== Pact Provider Configuration

Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider can be configured using Arquillian configuration mechanism (`arquillian.xml` file or system properties).

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
    http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

    <extension qualifier="pact-provider">
        <property name="port">8332</property>
    </extension>

</arquillian>
----

The attributes are:

|===
| Attribute Name | Description | Default Value

|targetUrl
|Url to used by `target` to connect to provider
|

|insecure
|In case of https if test should skip https validations
|false

|protocol
|protocol used to connect in case of not using `targetUrl` property
|http

|host
|host used to connect in case of not using `targetUrl` property
|localhost

|port
|port used to connect in case of not using `targetUrl` property
|8080

|path
|path appended at the end of the host in case of not using `targetUrl` property
|/

|===

Notice that in case of using incontainer tests you don't need to configure any of these parameters (except if _insecure_ is required) since you can use the URL injected by Arquillian.
See this at <<provincon, provider in container>> example.

== Pact States

Each interaction in a pact should be verified in isolation, with no context maintained from the previous interactions.
Provider states allow you to set up data on the provider by injecting it straight into the datasource before the interaction is run, so that it can make a response that matches what the consumer expects.

Provider states also allow the consumer to make the same request with different expected responses.

Provider state is all about the state of the provider, not about the state of the consumer, or about what is in the request.

In consumer side you set an state using `given` section.

For example:

`builder.given("test state")...` sets state as plain String.

Or in case you want to set some parameters you can do:

[source, java]
----
Map parameters = new HashMap<>();
builder.given("test state", parameters)...
----

which in this case sets an state name with some key/value pairs.

But in *Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider* we also give support for states in the form of _Cucumber_ expression.
You can define an state with the form:

`builder.given("I have 36 cukes in my belly")...`

So the next question is how can I respond to states in provider side?
Let's see an example in each case:

In first example you only set a state with a name, without any parameter, so in your provider side you are going to do:

[source, java]
----
@State("test state")
public void testStateMethod(Map<String, Object> params) {
    // Do some data preparation
}
----

This method is executed if and only if given interaction has defined the state `test state`.

Obviously in previous example you have no way to pass parameters from consumer to provider.
In second example you are passing a map with some parameters.
To recover them you need to add as method parameter a `Map`.

[source, java]
----
@State("test state")
public void testStateMethod(Map<String, Object> params) {
}
----

This method is executed if and only if given interaction has defined the state `test state` and injects the defined parameters in consumer as method parameter.

Also the third case uses Cucumber-lik expression, so you need similar way to take parameters.

[source, java]
----
@State("I have (\\d+) cukes in my belly")
public void stateMethod(int numberOfCukes) {
    this.numberOfCukes = numberOfCukes;
}
----

Notice that now as happens with Cucumber you need to specify the regular expression and you get the values as method parameters.
Native values and list are supported.
Lists are set in consumer side as comma-separated values and scanned as `\\s+`.

== AssertJ integration

Arquillian Algeron Pact Provider implements custom matcher of AssertJ for validating contracts against provider.

First thing to do to use AssertJ matcher is add `arquillian-algeron-pact-provider-assertj` dependency, and the *AssertJ* you want to use.

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.algeron</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-algeron-pact-provider-assertj</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.assertj</groupId>
    <artifactId>assertj-core</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Finally in your test you can use the overloaded `assertThat` static method receiving a `Target` type.

[source, java]
----
@ArquillianResource
URL webapp;

@ArquillianResource
Target target;

@Test
public void should_provide_valid_answers() {
    assertThat(target).withUrl(webapp).satisfiesContract();
}
----

Notice that now instead of writing `target.testInteraction(webapp);` you are using a more readable way of asserting test.

== Arquillian Recorder Reporter integration

Currently pact generates report from contract tests in several formats, including Markdown or JSON.
You can also report using Arquillian Recorder Reporter (https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-recorder) extension.

To use it you need to annotate at test class level with `VerificationReports` and set type to `recorder` and add Arquillian Recorder Reporter dependency `org.arquillian.extension:arquillian-recorder-reporter-impl:<version>`.

TIP: you can set more than reporter at once so you can do `@VerificationReports(value = {"console", "recorder"})`.

[[JBoss_Forge_Arquillian_Algeron_Provider_Addon]]
== JBoss Forge Arquillian Addon

http://forge.jboss.org[Forge] Arquillian Addon offers an integration with Arquillian Algeron Provider.

To use it apart from having the Forge Arquillian Addon installed in Forge, you need to have arquillian dependencies registered on build tool.

To register Arquillian Provider dependencies in build tool just run next command:

`arquillian-algeron-setup-provider --contracts-library pact`

After that you can enrich a given Arquillian test with provider annotations:

`arquillian-algeron-create-provider-test --provider myprovider --test-class org.superbiz.MyContractTest`

It is important to note that test class should be already created (for example using `arquillian-create-test --named MyContractTest --target-package org.superbiz` command).
